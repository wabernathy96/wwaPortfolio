      <h4>The Great Outdoors</h4>

      <p>The outdoors are my home. Whatever the activity might be - from hiking to fishing, or even just stepping out of my
        back door for a breath of fresh air; I always appreciate the feeling of the sun on my face. I've been hiking and
        hunting since I was young and both have given me an extreme love for the land and all creatures who inhabit it. All
        of my best memories are outdoors - including getting the opportunity to meet Steven Pinker at Dream Lake. </p>

      <h4>Skateboarding</h4>
      <p>Skateboarding has always been a passion of mine. The feeling of eurthane rolling over concrete is irreplicable. The
        sport belongs to a community of strong individuals who are almost always supportive of each other. Skateboarding
        has taught me a lot of lessons that I wont soon forget and will be something that I always love. </p>

      <h4>Illustration</h4>
      <p>Creating artwork has always been a passion of mine, and is actually what propelled me into design, and subsequently,
        programming. I love working with ink, watercolor, and pencil as well as digital media. One thing I love about art
        as well as many of my other hobbies is that there is always room to improve. </p>

      <h4>Music</h4>
      <p>Music is a huge part of my life. I love everything from Ahmad Jamail to Commodores, bands like Nihilist and Morta Skuld,
        to bands like Crosby, Stills, and Nash or Flatland Cavalry. I just love music that has someones heart and soul poured
        into it. I have been to countless Red Dirt Country shows in my life and am a country music purist. However, I found
        my home in Houston's hardcore punk scene. It provides a healthy outlet for me as well as most that go to shows, and
        has a very supportive community. Below is a photo of Mammoth Grinder - a metal band from Austin, Texas that's one
        of my favorites. </p>

      <h4>Sports</h4>
      <p>I've never followed sports too closely aside from going to Houston Astros games since I was very young. However, in
        recent years I've been following baseball closely, and I've found a new love - eSports. Houston now has an Overwatch
        League team - the Houston Outlaws. Both the Outlaws and the Astros are two teams that I will continue to follow in
        the future.</p>

      <h4>Craft Brewing</h4>
      <p>I love that craft brewing has surged to the forefront of the American beer industry in recent years. I'm a huge proponent
        of small breweries. My current favorite is Eureka Heights in Houston, Texas. I like IPAs generaly, but also enjoy
        a nice stout or belgian quadrupel on occasion.</p>
